/* Purpose:
 This program allows user to input R for rock, S for scissor, P for paper. Once the Inpute is made by user, it compares the Inpute to Computer's Inpute. To allow from computer we need #include <cstdlib> and #include <ctime> which randomly draws number which we need to conver 0 for R, 1 for S, 2 for P. IF-ELSE statements and Switch Statements were used to follow the choises.
