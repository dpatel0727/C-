/* Purpose:
 This program allows user to input 4 values and print 4 values as output such as P,r,n,t. This code also calculates
 the amount of money paid back after following years with interest included. The formula used here is P * (pow(1 + (r/n), (n*t))). Also for this lab we had to use #include <cmath> to input all the math operations and #include <iomanip> to formate decimal places.
